### 🚀 Featured Projects

#### 🧠 **QA-Bot – ASUS FAQ AI Chatbot**
A Streamlit-powered chatbot that analyzes voice queries using **sentiment**, **emotion**, **tone**, and **domain relevance**, retrieves responses from a dataset, and offers an admin dashboard for insights.  
**Tech:** Python, NLP, MySQL, Streamlit  

#### 🌱 AI-Driven Air Quality Monitoring System
 Using Satellite Data + AI for PM2.5/PM10 Prediction.
 
 **Objective**:
 Predict city-level particulate matter (PM2.5/PM10) concentrations by fusing:
 • Satellite AOD (INSAT-3D)
 • Ground sensors (CPCB)
 • Weather data (MERRA-2)
 
 **How It Works**:
 1. Data Fusion: Integrates AOD, weather (wind, PBLH), and historical PM.
 2. AI Model: XGBOOST predicts PM levels with <5µg/m³ MAE (validated against ground data).
 3. Visualization: Interactive maps and dashboards show real-time PM/AQI

#### 🔥 **Founder’s Fuel (RAG, GenAI, NLP, Web Search, Pretrained Models)**

1. Built an AI-powered startup analysis platform featuring a RAG chatbot for 7-domain evaluation and live competitor research.  
2. Engineered a pitch deck analyzer and recommendation engine connecting startups with 3,000+ investors and accelerators.  
3. Leveraged pretrained NLP models (RoBERTa, BERT-base-NER, Sentence Transformers) to track startup progress and provide insights from historical data.
